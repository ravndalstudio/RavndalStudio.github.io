							<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Thank you for using Checklist app (the "Application"), developed by Ravndal Studio ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>
						<p>This Application is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. All of your personal content, including checklists, notes, location data, and schedules, is stored exclusively on your local device and is never uploaded to our servers.</p>
					</article>

						<h3>Information You Provide:</h3>
						<ul>

						<h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Anonymized Usage Data:</strong> We use Amplitude, a third-party analytics service, to collect anonymous and aggregated data about how you interact with the Application.</li>

						</ul>

							<h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Payment Handling:</strong> All payments for subscriptions are processed securely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play), depending on your device. Ravndal Studio does not collect, receive, or store any of your personal payment information, such as credit card details. Payment information is handled directly by Apple or Google, in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>
						<p>The Application offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions to unlock premium features.<br>
							Payment Processing: All payments are processed securely through Apple's App Store In-App Purchase system. We do not collect, receive, or store any of your personal payment information, such as credit card details. Payment information is handled directly by Apple.<br>						
							Subscription Management (RevenueCat): To manage your subscription status (for example, to verify if you are a "Premium" user) and to enable features across different devices (if applicable), we use a third-party service called RevenueCat.</p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<header>
									<h2>5a. Subscription Management (RevenueCat)</h2>
								</header>
							<p>RevenueCat acts as an intermediary layer between our app and the App Store. To provide this service, RevenueCat automatically collects and stores:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Anonymous User Identifier: A randomly generated ID that is not linked to your personal identity but allows RevenueCat to track your purchase status.</li>
								<li>Purchase History: Information about the product you purchased (e.g., "annual_subscription") and its expiry date.</li>
							</ul>
							RevenueCat does not get access to your personal data, Apple ID, or any payment details. The data collected by RevenueCat is used only to validate your subscription, ensure you have access to the features you paid for, and help us analyze the performance of our subscription offerings.<br>											
							For more information on how RevenueCat handles your data, please review the RevenueCat Privacy Policy.</p>

							<h2>7. Data Security and Deletion</h2>
						</header>
						<p>We take the security of your data seriously. For notes where you enable the secure storage option (the padlock icon), we implement strong security measures:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Secret notes within the app are encrypted using AES-256 (CBC/PKCS7)</li>
							<li>The encryption uses a unique key that is generated and stored securely on your device</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To delete all your data, you simply need to uninstall the Application from your device.</p>
